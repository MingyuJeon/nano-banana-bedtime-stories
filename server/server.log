Character description: A young child, appearing to be around 4-7 years old, stands with an open and joyful demeanor. He has dark brown, almost black hair that is neatly cut short, swept slightly to the side with a natural, soft texture, revealing some lighter brown highlights at the crown due to the sun. His bright, wide-set eyes are a deep, dark brown, almost black, and are alight with a cheerful expression, complemented by prominent, well-defined dark eyebrows. His face is an oval to slightly heart shape, with soft, rounded cheeks and a fair to light olive skin tone that appears healthy and smooth. A charming, wide smile reveals his small, evenly spaced teeth. He wears a short-sleeved, crew-neck t-shirt featuring horizontal stripes of varying widths in alternating shades of light sky blue, medium royal blue, and white, with a solid royal blue breast pocket on the left side. Below, he wears standard indigo blue denim jeans. His body type is slender and age-appropriate, and he stands with a relaxed, upright posture, hands resting loosely at his sides, conveying an approachable and happy presence.

Character description: This is a cheerful young boy, appearing to be between 4 and 6 years old, with a bright, innocent demeanor. He has short, straight, dark brown hair that is parted slightly to the left, falling neatly across his forehead just above his eyebrows, and trimmed just above his ears. His eyes are a deep, dark brown, almost black, and almond-shaped, with a crinkling joyful expression as he smiles. His face is a soft, youthful oval with full, slightly rosy cheeks and fair to light skin. He has a small, slightly upturned nose and a wide, open-mouthed smile revealing a full set of small, even white teeth. His eyebrows are well-defined and gently arched. He stands upright with a relaxed posture, hands casually at his sides, showcasing a slender but healthy child's build. He is dressed in a short-sleeved, crew-neck t-shirt featuring horizontal stripes that alternate between white, a light sky blue, and a vibrant medium blue, with a small functional pocket on the left chest. He wears dark blue denim jeans. There are no unique identifying marks such as moles or scars visible on his exposed skin.
